I want to make a Chrome extension that does webpage summarization. It must have these features:
1) When people click on the extension, It should expand a page on the right side of the current webpage for people to interact
2) In the interactive page, it should have two tabs: Content and Settings
3) In "Settings" tab, it must have setting button for people to configure the AI model including these information
- Base OpenAI Compatible URL
- API Key
- Model Name
- System prompt
- Sidebar Width: to control the width of the sidebar
- Font size: to control the size of the font used in chat area in the "Content" tab
- A "Save" button to save all above information so users do not have to fill in again
4) In "Content" tab:
* At the top:
** there should be a "Summarize" button to allow user to summarize the content of current page and show it to a chat area below.
** there should be a "Clear" button to clear all the content in the chat area.
5) "Content" tab acts as a chat page, after getting the summary, users can chat with the AI models about the content of the page. You need to keep track which messages from the AI model and which messages from the user to display accordingly.
6) when doing summarization, you'll need to use the "System prompt" in the "Settings" tab. There should be a default system prompt if users don't set it themselves.
