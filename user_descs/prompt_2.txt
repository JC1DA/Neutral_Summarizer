# Neutral Summarizer Chrome Extension - Requirements

## Overview
A Chrome extension that summarizes web pages and enables chat functionality with an AI model about the page content, with all interactions happening in a sidebar that expands on the right side of the current webpage.

## Core Features

### 1. Extension Interface
- When clicked, the extension expands a sidebar on the right side of the current webpage. Do not show a popup to ask user to click to open the sidebar. The sidebar should expand immediately when opening the extension.
- The sidebar contains a header with a close button (âœ•) in the top-right corner
- The sidebar contains two tabs: "Content" and "Settings"
- The close button allows users to collapse the sidebar and return to the full webpage view

### 2. Settings Tab
The settings tab allows users to configure the AI model with these options:
- Base OpenAI Compatible URL (default: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1)
- API Key
- Model Name (default: qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507)
- System Prompt (with a default prompt provided)
- Sidebar Width (300-800 pixels, default: 400)
- Font Size (10-24 pixels, default: 14)
- Save button to persist settings across sessions

### 3. Content Tab
The content tab serves as a chat interface with these features:
- Two equally-sized buttons horizontally aligned: "Summarize Page" and "Clear Chat"
- Summarize button: Generates a summary of the current web page content
- Clear button: Clears all messages from the chat area
- Chat display area: Shows conversation between user and AI. Chat area should be able to parse and show markdown format properly.
- Message input field: Allows users to ask questions about the page content
- Send button: Submits user questions to the AI

### 4. Functionality Requirements
- All API calls must use streaming mode to provide real-time updates as the AI generates responses
- The summarization feature uses the system prompt configured in the settings
- After initial summarization, users can continue chatting with the AI about the page content
- The extension must track and properly display which messages are from the user vs. the AI
- Settings are persisted using Chrome's storage API
- The sidebar can be closed using the close button in the header or by clicking the extension icon again

### 5. Technical Requirements
- Built as a Chrome extension using manifest version 3
- Uses modern JavaScript with async/await for API calls
- Implements proper error handling for API requests
- Follows Chrome extension security best practices
- Responsive design that works with the configurable sidebar width
- Uses message passing between background script, content script, and popup for sidebar management
